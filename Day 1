Question: Theory regarding DSA
Solution: On day 1 I started with my revision of DSA theory. Where i learned about algorithms and types of data structures as stack, queue, linked list etc. 
for starting with DSA make sure you are clear with these topics including space and time complexity with calculating it using big O notation, omega notation and theta notation.
As further i will move ahead i will share my updates on theory part.
from day 2 you can access my coding challenge on both github and linkedin.
