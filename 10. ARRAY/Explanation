In the given problem regarding how to remove an element from an array we take an input array and the value to be removed.
We simply run a loop till the length of array and create a counter variable which increases by 1 as soon as it matches with the given value 
and the value present at index of i.
In the else part of the loop we increase the value of array nums by 1 and place the value at index i in the same position.
Further coming out of the function we return the length of the array minus the counter increased, which tells us the n umber of elements 
removed from our array

This is the approach that i have followed if any one of you has a better approach, i am always open for suggestions.
