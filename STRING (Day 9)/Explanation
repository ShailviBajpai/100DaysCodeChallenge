EXPLANATION:
As we see that we are given an input in form of string array where we have to find out the maximum number of words in the string array
considered as sentences in the problem.
In the question we will follow the use of some string functions such as splt.
by creating an another function to split the strings from each array at a specific index.

Further we input a variable max which will. work as a counter variable and check for every previous string index whether it is possible to be greater or not.
Then until max becomes the last value of the strings in the array, which means that it runs till the length of the array string, it will
continue to do so.
At the end it returns max which will tell us the number of maximum words in an array.
