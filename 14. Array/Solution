QUESTION: https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/

SOLUTION: 
class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
       int x=0;
       for(int i=0; i<operations.length; i++) //A loop to run till the length-1 of string array
       {
           if(operations[i].charAt(1)=='+') //we will find and check which operation to be performed
           {
               x++;  //we will increase the value of x
           }
         else
         {
             x--;  //we will decrease the value of x
         }  
       }
       return x;  //return the last value of x as answer.
    }
}
