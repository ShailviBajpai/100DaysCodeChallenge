DESCRIPTION: You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

DESCRIPTION: In the above question we have considered two strings as jewels and stones with ome same and some different charecters, further we check whether the stones are equal to jewels or not, and make a count of it.
