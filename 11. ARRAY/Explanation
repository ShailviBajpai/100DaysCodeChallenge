EXPLANATION: Here I will show the approach that i have assumed.

First we will input a array and the target to be found.
Then we initialize start and end of the array, to find the middle value and the index of the saem.
then we run the loop until start is less than or equal to end and check for 3 important conditions.

1ST CASE: if the target is less than arr[mid], then we will update the value of end,
and move it to right hand side.

2ND CASE: if the target is greater than the value at arr[mid], then we will update the value of start,
and move it to left hand side.
Possible until arr[mid]= target, then we will return the mid.

3RD CASE: If the number doesnt exist in array.
it will come out of the function and return -1.
