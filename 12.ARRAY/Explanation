CONCATENATION OF ARRAY

The approach that i have used for the given question is by declaring an another array with 
double the size of original array.
then as usual we run the loop till the length of original array .
Further in the new array we store the valu at same indexes as equivalent to the original array.
Then in the new array we store the value at index which comes at nums.length+i, which increases everytime 
with increase in the index of original array.
The process continues till the length of array.

Then coming out of the function we return the new array created which was ans.
